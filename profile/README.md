## GOALS AND TARGET
- ### LESS FOOD WASTEAGE:
       Via this platfrom , an event organizer can save food wasteage by giving corresponding food availability and can hoard the 
       food a nearly 50-65% market cost, thus avoiding loses
 - ### CHEAP AVAILABILITY OF FOOD:
       An Important factor apart from raw materials and fuel required is TIME. This TIME factor pursuades many to buy food from
       external sources.Via this app we can reduce the expenditure and in some scenario reduce the public hunger.
 
 - ### REDUCE LOSS FOR FRUITS & VEGETABLE VENDORS:
       Vendors can put fruits and vegetables along with viability period left and this factor decides the cost of their item.
       This reduces the stress on these vendors preventing excess use of pesticides.
      
- ### REDUCE LIFESTYLE DESEASES:
       Apart from banishing the usage of pesticide we tend to reduce the unpopular culture of using food after long refrigeration
       via this platform as we supply excess food to the demand chain.
       
- ### EMPLOYEMENT OPPURTUNITY: 
       Many get part time job as deliveryboy providing them additional income.
